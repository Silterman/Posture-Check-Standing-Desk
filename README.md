# Posture-Check-Standing-Desk
CLI script to keep track and remind you when you should sit down or stand down at your desk.

Currently still in development. Timer is set to notify every 30 seconds for testing purposes.

TBC:
* Fix inconsistent notification output regarding sit/stand advice. It's not following the ratio correctly.
* Allow for quitting of program with a command (without closing the CL).
